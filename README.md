### Keras Reverse Image Search using Locality Sensitive Hashing on Caltech 101 Dataset

For downloading the Dataset:
http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech101/

Steps Followed:
1 Loading the data
2 Used vgg16 and take the last dense layer output.
3 Make a feature vector of all the training data.
4 For the test data, to check similarity used LSH and Cosine Similarity.
